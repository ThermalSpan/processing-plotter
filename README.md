# Processing - Plotter

### What?

This is a 3D plotting utility that I wrote to help myself out at work. It allows the user to import an XML styled file containing coordinates for lines and points. The user can then move the camera around in a manner reminiscent of a 3D modelling program.

### How?

Export a file from you program of choice that adheres to the following formatting.

```
<point> 1.0 1.0 1.0 </point>
<line> 1.0 1.0 1.0 ... </point>
```
